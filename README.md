# The CCML language

#### Overview

The CCML language and implementation are a very simple, hackable and embeddable.
A great deal of attention has been paid to keeping the implementation simple and
small.

Why have I made a new language?  Is a reasonable question, but the answer is
simply... to satisfy my own curiosity, and desire for learning new things.
CCML was born as a learning exercise to spend a weekend implementing a compiler
and virtual machine for a very simple language.  A secondary goal was to keep
the language as simple as I possibly could, to see how useful such a basic
language could be.

Now that the basic implementation is up and running, i'm adding new features and
extending the language, while keeping things simple but no simpler.

Language/implementation features:
- Hand crafted recursive decent parser
- Variables can only be of signed integer type
- There are two control flow constructs; `if` and `while`
- Variables can be `global` or `local`
- Supports global and local array types
- Functions take arguments and return values
- Compiler and virtual machine are embeddable
- External functions can be implemented in C++
- Very simple stack based virtual machine
- Small byte code (~27 instructions currently)
- Support for multitasking and multiple threads
- Debug information is generated during compilation
- No external dependencies
- Robust testing
- Extensively commented source code

What does CCML look like?  Check out the follow simple example:
```
function is_prime(x)
  var i = 2
  while (i < x / 2)
    if (x % i == 0)
      return 0
    end
    i = i + 1
  end
  return 1
end
```


#### The pipeline

CCML follows a very conventional language pipeline for which, execution can be
broken into the following broad stages.

```
 source code --.
                \ 
                 \ . lexer
                  \ . parser
                   \ . assembler
                    \ . optimizer
                     \ . bytecode
                      \
                       '--> virtual machine
```
